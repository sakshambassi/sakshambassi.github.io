        <h1> Oliktok November 22, 2017: Cloud destabilization </h1>
        This is a case where a small instabilitiy in a cloud slowly grows in an oscillating fashion. The instability starts at -68 minutes on the first plot. You can see this in velocity in the middle panel. Eventually the instability grows to dominate the cloud and breaks up some. Around -20 minutes you can see where a dry layer separates the cloud, but the instability in air motion is present in both clouds. Spectrum width (an indicator of turbulence) also tracks these motions well. There are additional data links below
